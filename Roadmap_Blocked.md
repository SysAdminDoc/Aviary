# Aviary blocked roadmap

## F032 — Hide blocked accounts again

Blocked pending an authenticated `_decoded/` home/status capture containing the current blocked-account markup. The existing public fixtures do not expose the required `[data-testid="userActions"]` blocked state, so shipping a predicate now would be speculative.

Re-entry condition: add the authenticated capture, verify the live selector, then implement and fixture-test the predicate while preserving the handle whitelist.

## F033 — Hide self-quotes and self-reposts

Blocked pending an authenticated `_decoded/` quote/thread capture containing the current repost attribution row. The existing fixtures do not expose the `Reposted by @<handle>` relationship needed for a reliable author-equality check.

Re-entry condition: add the authenticated capture, verify the social-context selector, then implement and fixture-test self-repost detection without broad text heuristics.
